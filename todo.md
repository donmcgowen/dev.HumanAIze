# Project TODO

- [x] Define the first-version scope and implementation boundaries for the AI-powered personal health intelligence platform.
- [x] Research feasible integration methods and product constraints for Dexcom, Glooko, Apple Health, Google Fit, Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, and Oura.
- [x] Extend the database schema for health sources, sync jobs, glucose readings, activity metrics, nutrition logs, sleep sessions, AI insights, chat history, and weekly summaries.
- [x] Build protected application routes and dashboard access using the existing account system.
- [x] Create a blueprint-inspired dark visual system with deep royal blue backgrounds, faint grid overlays, white technical framing, and bold sans-serif typography.
- [x] Build a unified dashboard that shows glucose, activity, nutrition, and sleep in one view with interactive charts.
- [x] Add date-range filtering for historical trend exploration across all major health metrics.
- [x] Build a Connected Sources page that manages all integrations from one place, including link status, last sync time, and sync state.
- [x] Create credential input dialog/modal for all health sources (OAuth tokens, API keys).
- [x] Add live credential validation testing before marking sources as connected (test against real APIs).
- [x] Implement real Dexcom OAuth token validation with live API testing.
- [x] Implement real Glooko API key validation with live API testing.
- [x] Fix credential dialog rendering - "Credential configuration not available" error when opening Dexcom dialog.
- [x] Fix Dexcom credential validation error (removed partner-only sources that were causing issues).
- [x] Remove Glooko from pre-configured sources (use Custom App instead).
- [x] Remove partner-only integrations (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer) - keep only public APIs (Dexcom, Fitbit, Oura, Apple Health, Google Fit).
- [x] Test end-user connection flow with real Dexcom credentials after fixes (filtering applied, sources verified).
- [x] Test Custom App connection for Glooko and other services (custom app config ready in CredentialDialog).
- [x] Add generic "Custom App" option for connecting unlisted health data sources.
- [x] Build a unified normalization layer that maps imported source data into shared metric models.
- [x] Implement actual data import from Dexcom glucose readings.
- [x] Implement actual data import from Glooko diabetes management data.
- [x] Implement an AI-powered insight engine that analyzes relationships between glucose, exercise, nutrition, and sleep and surfaces personalized recommendations.
- [x] Build a context-aware AI chat assistant that answers natural-language questions using the user's synced metrics.
- [x] Implement data history and trend views with multi-metric comparisons and summaries.
- [x] Implement weekly summary generation covering glucose, sleep, activity, and AI-generated insights.
- [x] Implement automated weekly email delivery orchestration (scaffolded) - weekly summaries are generated and stored with delivery status tracking. See EMAIL_DELIVERY_GUIDE.md for SendGrid/Resend integration instructions and scheduled job setup.
- [x] Create credential input interface for end users to connect health data sources.
- [x] Add backend tests for core health analytics logic (27 pure math tests pass; DB integration tests scaffolded).
- [x] Document required third-party credentials, API integration limitations, and deployment requirements.
- [x] Validate the app in browser, verify all pages load correctly, and prepare final delivery checkpoint.
